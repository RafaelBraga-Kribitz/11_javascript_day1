# JavaScript Introduction

We’ve spent some time with HTML and CSS. We know that:
- HTML gives us the structure of the page.
- CSS helps style it and make it beautiful.

However, everything we've done so far is static. It just sits there and looks pretty. Today, we’ll start learning **JavaScript**, a programming language that will make webpages **interactive**.

## What can JavaScript do?
JavaScript can:
- Respond when someone clicks a button.
- Create popups, animations, and much more.

Of course, we won’t learn everything today—just the basics. We will start slowly and build up from there.

### Key Concept
Think of it this way:
- **HTML** is the structure.
- **CSS** is the design.
- **JavaScript** is the brain that makes things happen.

## JavaScript Evolution
JavaScript has gone through many versions and updates. One of the biggest updates is **ECMAScript 6** (ES6), which introduced many new features. We’ll focus on using **ES6 features** in this course, but I’ll also show you how things were done before.

## Including JavaScript in HTML

There are two ways to include JavaScript in your HTML file:
1. **Internal JavaScript**: Placing JavaScript directly within your HTML file.
2. **External JavaScript**: Linking an external JavaScript file.

### Example: Internal JavaScript
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JS Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <script>
    alert('Hello there!');
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

- Place JavaScript right before the closing `</body>` tag inside `<script>` tags.
- This approach works for short code snippets or simple exercises.

### Example: External JavaScript
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JS Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

- Create a separate file called `script.js`.
- Link the external file using the `<script>` tag with the `src` attribute.

## Using the Console

JavaScript offers a **Console** to print values and debug code. You can access it via your browser's Developer Tools:
1. Right-click on the page and select **Inspect**.
2. Navigate to the **Console** tab.

### Example: Console Output
```js
console.log('Hello there');
```
- Use `console.log()` to print output to the console.

---

## Comments in JavaScript

You can add comments to your JavaScript code to make it easier to understand.

### Single-line Comment
```js
// This is a single-line comment
```

### Multi-line Comment
```js
/*
 This is a multi-line comment
*/
```

## Variables in JavaScript

In programming, a **variable** is a container for a value. JavaScript offers three ways to declare variables:
- `var`
- `let`
- `const`

### `var`
```js
var myName = 'Viola';
console.log(myName);
```

- `var` was the original way to declare variables but is rarely used today due to scoping issues.

### `let`
```js
let myName = 'Viola';
myName = 'John';
console.log(myName);
```

- `let` allows you to declare a variable that can be reassigned.

### `const`
```js
const pi = 3.14;
console.log(pi);
```

- `const` is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned.

## Data Types in JavaScript

JavaScript supports multiple data types, but the most common ones are:

- **String**: Represents textual data.
  ```js
  let greeting = 'Good morning';
  ```
  
- **Number**: Represents numeric data.
  ```js
  let number = 42;
  ```
  
- **Boolean**: Represents logical values (`true` or `false`).
  ```js
  let isRaining = true;
  ```

### Undefined and Null
- **Undefined**: A variable has been declared but not assigned a value.
- **Null**: A variable is explicitly set to have no value.

---

## String Concatenation

You can combine strings in JavaScript using two methods:

### Using the `+` Operator
```js
let fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;
```

### Using Template Literals (ES6)
```js
let fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
```

---

## JavaScript Methods

JavaScript provides many built-in methods to work with data types.

### Common String Methods
- `.length`: Returns the length of the string.
- `.toUpperCase()`: Converts the string to uppercase.
- `.toLowerCase()`: Converts the string to lowercase.

---

## Arrays in JavaScript

An **array** is a collection of values stored in a single variable.

### Example: Declaring an Array
```js
let grades = [70, 90, 88, 92, 76];
```

### Accessing Array Elements
- Arrays are **zero-indexed**, meaning the first element has an index of 0.

### Modifying an Array Element
```js
grades[2] = 75;
```

---

## Array Methods

JavaScript provides several methods for working with arrays.

### Adding and Removing Elements
- `.push()`: Adds an element to the end of the array.
- `.pop()`: Removes the last element of the array.
- `.unshift()`: Adds an element to the beginning of the array.
- `.shift()`: Removes the first element of the array.

### Splicing Arrays
The `.splice()` method can be used to add, remove, or replace elements in an array.

---

## Type Conversion

JavaScript can convert values between different data types.

### Example: Implicit Conversion
```js
let result = '3' + 2; // '32'
```

### Example: Explicit Conversion
```js
let num = parseInt('15');
```

---

## Best Practices

- Always use `const` for variables that won't change.
- Use `let` when the value of a variable will change.
- Avoid using `var` unless necessary.

That's all for today! We’ll continue building on these concepts in the next lesson.
