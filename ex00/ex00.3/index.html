        <strong>Exercise 3: Array of Players</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Create an array called <code>players</code> with the names: Martin, Thomas, Peter, Mathias, and Niki.</li>
          <li>Output the third player in the console as: "The most valuable player of the match is [Third Player Name]".</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>
      To solve this exercise, we need to create an array called <code>players</code> with the names: Martin, Thomas, Peter, Mathias, and Niki.
      We can use the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag to include JavaScript code.
    </p>
    <h4>Code</h4>
    <pre>
      &lt;script&gt;
        var players = ["Martin", "Thomas", "Peter", "Mathias", "Niki"];

        console.log("The most valuable player of the match is " + players[2]); // Peter
        console.log("The least valuable player of the match is " + players[0]); // Martin
      &lt;/script&gt;
    </pre>
    <h4>Result</h4>
    <p>
      The result of this exercise is to print "The most valuable player of the match is Peter" and "The least valuable player of the match is Martin" in the browser console.
